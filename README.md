# ManageBacToTheFuture

> ManageBac for Humans

ManageBacToTheFuture provides a new web ui for ManageBac.  It has a Google+
style cards stream that is time sorted.

There is also a python ManageBac api (a giant hack on top of bs4) in the `/lib`
folder.  It even has documentation, run `make html` in `/`.
